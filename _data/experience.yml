    As somebody that loves the outdoors, the idea of working for REI excited me, which is why I was thrilled to start working for REIâ€™s Experiences division. Specifically, I work as a front-end engineer on a small team building the user interface that comprises the Adventures subdomain. Our group builds guide-led, multi-day trips to exotic destinations that go all the way to Antarctica!
    
    We follow an agile SDLC and use the continuous delivery approach coupled with automated deployments. My day-to-day involves daily stand-ups, story refinement meetings, retros, and building new features for and maintaining the Adventures micro-site. We have a company-wide initiative to convert all existing front-end assets to <mark>Vue.js</mark> and have a private <mark>npm</mark> registry for shared components.

    I interface with all walks of the SDLC including management, business, stakeholders, designers, and other engineers.
