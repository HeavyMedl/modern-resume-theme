    My professors collaborated to develop a computer science program whose curriculum overlapped and interweaved to reinforce domain concepts. The continuity of instruction from the same professors over a multi-year course load helped solidify many important fundamentals for me and has helped me throughout my professional career.

    The <mark>Computer Science Foundations</mark> program was comprised of the following courses:
    - Introduction to Programming in Haskell
    - Java Programming I, II
    - Computer Organization: Digital Logic, Instruction Set Architecture
    - Computer Architecture I, II: Assembly languages, JVM
    - Discrete Mathematics I, II, III
    - Seminar: Explorations in the Cognitive Science of Mathematics and Computing, Ethics and Technology, Explorations in Robotics

    The following year, being fascinated by Computer Science, and having learned proper fundamentals, I continued with <mark>Computability and the Study of Formal Languages</mark> whose coursework included:
    
    - Formal Languages I, II
    - Programming Language Design I, II
    - Programming Language Design Project I, II
    - Haskell I
    - Advanced Haskell II

    I completed my degree with the <mark>Computing Practice and Theory</mark> program which was a project-oriented program focused on pattern matching and modeling within the context of environmental science.

    I can't say enough good things about my experience at Evergreen. The school's unique approach to education gave me a solid foundation in Computer Science and has enabled me to excel as a professional developer.

    My first experience with college was at SPSCC. I participated in the "Running Start" program during high school which allowed me to earn high school and college credit simultaneously. I primarily studied Music Theory and Music Composition there.
