    Below is an incomplete list of business features that I have contributed to at Costco.

    **Gas Prices Online**

    We created a REST service that sourced Costco warehouse gas prices from an Oracle DB and stored them in a cache layer to be exposed on various Costco properties including its warehouse locator pages and its mobile apps.

    **Site Redesign**

    Development lead for a project that saw many major flows throughout costco.com redesigned or reimagined entirely. Including but not limited to the checkout flow, product detail pages, and search. I worked closely with on and offshore developers on this project.

    **SEO Improvements**

    More of a biannual project, our team responded to third-party SEO audits in which we prioritized the most effective changes to SEO for the better, whether those be minor updates or major overhauls to parts of the application.

    **Member-only Purchase**

    Development lead for a feature enhancement that restricted costco.com users to those whose profiles were "validated". Previously, Costco allowed non-member shopping with a 5% checkout surcharge. This project was meant to drive membership subscriptions for Costco. We directed unvalidated users through validation flows where they had the opportunity to link (validate), buy, or renew their membership with Costco. The validation process involved cross-checking user-supplied data with our Membership API.

    **SMS Notifications**

    Development lead for a feature enhancement to bring text notifications to the user for order status visibility. The first iteration of this project involved sending a new SMS phone element to our order management system (OMS) for transmission to our LTL (less-than-truckload) carriers. The second iteration involved introducing a profile-level number that is transmitted to the third-party Infobip via OMS. Order status updates in OMS trigger SMS notifications.

    **Responsive Redesign**

    Working closely with BAs, business stakeholders, and UX designers, we replaced Costcoâ€™s entire legacy web application with a modern responsive solution. We used Bootstrap as our responsive framework and supported 5 different device resolutions. We used technologies like Node, SCSS, Webpack for asset bundling, Mocha for unit testing, and Selenium for browser testing.
    

    **CRM and Manual Authentication**

    This was one of my first projects as a developer at Costco. I worked on the UI that allowed customers to manage their membership details on costco.com. Additionally, I enhanced a back end system that would process new membership sign-ups at the warehouse and set the customer up with an online profile if one wasn't already present.
